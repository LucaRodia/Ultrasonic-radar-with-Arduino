# Ultrasonic-radar-with-Arduino
The project aims to build a radar using only an ultrasonic distance sensor and a servo motor connected to an Arduino board.

## Brief code explaination

#### servo_control.ino
This script controls the sensor and the actuator.
It keeps the servo rotating between 0째 and 180째 by changing the goal of the servo every iteration (using a proper delay) adding a dx angle to the current goal.
When 0째 or 180째 are reached, dx gets his sign changed (dx = -dx).

The ultrasonic distance sensor gets the distance (converting the travel time of the sound into cm) and writes it on the serial port.

#### data_reception_tester.py
Simpe script to check is the serial communication between Arduino and VSCode is working.

#### sweep_plotter.py
Given the angle theta (from serial port) it calculates the proper equation to plot a line with and angle theta in respect to the bottom of the screen.
